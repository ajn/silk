Things I'm looking into at the moment (any help greatly appreciated):

* Improve App API

* Fix bug: Why is content being stored twice when updated?! The existing record loses the path then a new record is created... hmm...

* How do we make testing/speccing fully self-contained within the plugin. At the moment I'm using the silk_testing app (which contains the silk plugin) for this and running: rake spec:silk

* Building a slick-as-hell user management interface: Creating new users, changing passwords, etc.

* Build a search feature for content. This should return near Google-like results which can be styled with CSS


Longer term goals:

* Create an 'App Store'-like plugin infrastructure to handle all the cool things we want to do in the future:
  News, Blogs, Twitter, Contact Us forms, etc
